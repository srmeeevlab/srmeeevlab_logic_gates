### The Programming Interface:

#### Your task here is to form an appropriate algorithm for understanding the experiment's workflow.

#### For a pre-built structure, navigate to “PreBuilt”, and click it. After doing so, follow steps a - e:

#### Step a: Navigate to the “Help” button and click on it.

#### Step b: Navigate to “Theory” in the modal displayed, and read the text for conceptual understanding.

![procedure for experiment 1 step b ](./images/Capture_Exp.1_Programming_Interface_b.PNG)

#### Step c: Navigate back to the interface.

![procedure for experiment 1 step c ](./images/Capture_Exp.1_Programming_Interface_c.PNG)

#### Step d: Verify the values in each element/block by clicking the element/block individually.

![procedure for experiment 1 step d ](./images/Capture_Exp.1_Programming_Interface_d.PNG)

#### Step e: Now, run the simulation and verify the results.

#### For forming the algorithm yourself, follow steps 1-10:

#### Step 1: Navigate to the “Help” button and click on it.

#### Step 2: Navigate to “Theory” in the modal displayed, and read the text for conceptual understanding.

![procedure for experiment 1 step 2.2 ](./images/Capture_Exp.1_Programming_Interface_2.PNG)

#### Step 3: Navigate back to the interface.

![procedure for experiment 1 step 2.3 ](./images/Capture_Exp.1_Programming_Interface_3.PNG)

#### Step 4: Use the palette provided on the left to navigate to the drag-drop elements/blocks. If required, please refer to the following image:

![procedure for experiment 1 step 2.4 ](./images/Capture_Exp.1_Programming_Interface_4.PNG)

#### Step 5: Upon selecting the element/block, drag it to the specified area.

![procedure for experiment 1 step 2.5 ](./images/Capture_Exp.1_Programming_Interface_5.png)

#### Step 6: Name the elements/blocks appropriately.

![procedure for experiment 1 step 2.6 ](./images/Capture_Exp.1_Programming_Interface_6.PNG)

#### Step 7: Fill in values for the elements/blocks chosen.

![procedure for experiment 1 step 2.7 ](./images/Capture_Exp.1_Programming_Interface_7.PNG)

#### Step 8: Click on the “Run” button. If required, you can view the image provided below to navigate to the “Run” button:
